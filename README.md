## Setup

There are two databases in this repository. One for dev data and another for test data.

You will need to create two .env files to utilise this repository: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
